# This was my attempt at fixing the random pw generator. I did collab on this with one of the TA's Mansi Patel. She helped me get started with the code. 
# The motivation behind this assingment was to fix a bug in order to get a pw to generate. 
# This solves the problem of people needing to create a secure password.
# I learned that coding, even when it comes to something definitely takes time and patience. I feel like I struggled through most of it because whenever I made any small changes, it stopped everything from working which becomes very frustrating.
